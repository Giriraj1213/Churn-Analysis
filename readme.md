# Customer Churn Analysis – Stage 2

This repository contains the Stage 2 deliverables for the Customer Churn Analysis project.  
Stage 2 focuses on data preparation and clustering analysis to ensure the dataset is suitable
for modelling and to identify meaningful customer segments.

---

## Project Overview

The objective of this stage is to:
- Prepare and clean the customer dataset
- Handle missing values and encode categorical variables
- Apply appropriate scaling techniques
- Split the data into training and testing sets
- Perform clustering analysis using K-Means
- Identify and visualise customer segments for actionable insights

## Repository Structure (Stage 2)

The repository is organised according to the Stage 2 submission requirements.

### 📁 Data_Preparation
This folder contains all data preparation deliverables:
- Preprocessed datasets with missing values handled and categorical variables encoded
- Scaled feature datasets used for modelling
- Training and testing datasets
- Data preprocessing scripts and notebooks
- Documentation describing the scaling techniques applied

**Key files include:**
- `cleaned_dataset.csv`
- `X_scaled.csv`
- `y.csv`
- `01_data_cleaning.ipynb`
- `preprocessing.py`

---

### 📁 Clustering_Analysis
This folder contains all clustering analysis deliverables:
- Elbow method analysis used to determine the optimal number of clusters
- Trained K-Means clustering implementation
- Clustered datasets and PCA outputs
- Visualisations of clusters with labels and interpretations

**Key files include:**
- `clustered_data.csv`
- `pca_clusters.csv`
- `02_clustering.ipynb`
- `clustering.py`
- Cluster visualisation images

---

### 📁 Modeling
This folder contains modelling-related files used in later stages, including:
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN) implementation
- Supporting notebooks and scripts

---

### 📁 reports
This folder contains the final project report and supporting figures.

## Notes
- The repository was restructured to align with Stage 2 deliverable requirements.
- Original folders and files have been retained for reference; all assessment-relevant
  materials are located within the `Data_Preparation` and `Clustering_Analysis` folders.
- **The code is not intended to be re-run by the marker**.
